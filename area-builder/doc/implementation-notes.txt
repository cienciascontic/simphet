The model is designed using screen coordinates as the size so that no model-
view transform is needed.

PropertySet is used for model objects with two or more properties.

In this sim, 'self' is being tried out as the way to make 'this' persistent
and thus usable in closures, rather than 'thisModel', 'thisScreen' and so
forth.

There is a pervasive concept in the code that is called "shape placement
boards". These are conceptually like real world poster boards or bulletin
boards, where items can be stuck on them and removed from them.

When working with - and within - the shape placement boards, the code
is sometimes written to work in terms of cells and at other times in terms of
model coordinates, whichever is most reasonable for the problem at hand.

Another central concept is that of a perimeter shape, which is a shape that is
defined by an ordered set of points, with straight lines being drawn between
the points when depicting it in the view.

In the game, there is a concept called the "build spec" that specifies what
the user is supposed to build.  This is used in many places throughout the
game.

STYLE NOTES:
For this simulation, the comments wrap at 120 characters.  This was generally done the same way for except in
a few circumstances where it made the code less readable (in the author's opinion).
