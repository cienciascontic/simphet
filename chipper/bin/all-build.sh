# Builds all chipper-like simulations.
# This must be run from the main "git" directory (the parent of all simulation/chipper repo directories)
# Usage: chipper/bin/all-build.sh
#                                     (named all-build because I like build.sh to
#                                      be tab-completed easily. lazy? yes)
